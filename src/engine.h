// engine.h - the composite: one audio timeline, two streaming models, one speaker-tagged transcript.
//
// Written for this repo. Both models run in-process, in the same loop, on the same pieces:
//
//   piece (100 ms)  ->  Nemotron-3 diar stream  ->  turn intervals (refined as we go)
//                 ->  x-asr stream              ->  text delta
//                 ->  Fusion                    ->  characters tagged with a speaker
//
// Feeding the diarizer BEFORE the transcriber per piece is deliberate: attribution needs the turn
// that covers the audio, and a turn that arrives one piece late shifts the first characters of
// every speaker change into the previous speaker.

    // stream_request_.options, so session options do nothing and a NULL request silently means
    // threshold=0.5, min_frames=0, pad_frames=0. Use {"speaker_threshold","0.35"} and friends.
    // Defaults measured, not copied from upstream (curve in README): speaker_pad_frames bridges gaps where
    // the diarizer fell below threshold mid-turn. DER-lite on the bilingual clips drops 40.9->30.3 (57s)
    // and 45.8->29.3 (45s, never tuned on) at pad=45, with false alarm <= 1.1. Silence/noise/tone still
    // produce ZERO turns at these settings. Raising pad further keeps helping on presentation-style audio
    // and will start merging fast turn-taking, so 45 (~1.7 s) is a middle choice, not the eval optimum.
    // SESSION-scoped diarizer options (audiocpp_options passed to session_create). The split is load-bearing:
    // the decode knobs (speaker_*) are read off the REQUEST, while the streaming geometry and memory sizing -
    // latency_profile, chunk_len, chunk_right_context, fifo_len, spkcache_len, spkcache_update_period,
    // graph_arena_mb, weight_context_mb, weight_type - are SESSION options and the library rejects them on a
    // request with "unknown Nemotron 3 diarization request option".
    // SHIPPED diar streaming geometry: the `custom` profile carrying very_high's own numbers, except
    // spkcache_len=128 instead of 264. Armed phone measurement (witness 2255 MHz): diar leg 11.94 -> 9.75 s
    // on chat69 and 5.99 -> 4.90 s on gate_ms_v2, i.e. composite 0.4701 -> 0.4141 and 0.4618 -> 0.4263.
    // Two controls make this attributable: (a) `custom` fed very_high's own 264 is byte-identical to the
    // shipped build and the same speed, so the win is the speaker cache, not the profile name; (b) 64 is
    // slower than 128 (30.0 s chat69), so this is a minimum, not a monotone "less memory is faster" slope.
    // Speaker memory shorter than the model's 264 frames moves turn boundaries on multi-window audio
    // (chat69 transcript hash changes, gate_ms_v2 does not), so this ships as a deliberate re-bless backed
    // by .auto/validate.sh evidence, not as a byte-identical change. Pass the old value back with
    // --diar-session-opt nemotron_3_diar.spkcache_len=264 to A/B it.
