// fusion.h - time-aligned speaker attribution: put the diarizer's turns onto the ASR's words.
//
// Written for this repo. The problem is specific to combining two streaming models whose output
// timelines do not line up:
//
//   * the ASR emits TEXT DELTAS at a wall-clock moment that lags the audio it decoded by roughly
//     one chunk (chunk_ms, plus whatever right context the encoder consumes);
//   * the diarizer emits TURN INTERVALS in audio time, refined as the stream advances.
//
// So a delta is not "at" a timestamp, it is a claim about an interval of audio. This file turns
// that claim into characters: the delta's codepoints are spread across the audio interval they
// describe, and each one is attributed to the turn overlapping it. Codepoints, not bytes - half of
// this model's output is Chinese, and byte-indexing would attribute a three-byte character to
// three different moments.
